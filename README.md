# UFOs_Analysis_Week_11
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a fully functioning website that gathered together different sightings of purported UFO
activity. After the data was collected into the website, it was necessary to create a filtering criteria to narrow down certain 
## Results
Based off the filtering criteria, anyone that uses the website can filter out based off of date, city, state, country, and/or shape.
The provided index.html file can be used to access the website that was created with the data being pulled from the data.js file.
Below is an example showing how you the website automatically updates and collects the information based on the five different filtered 
fields. In the iamge, it has been filtered to select a date of 1/1/2010, State of California, and a shape of Light. The image shows that 
there are 7 sightings that fit that criteria.

## Summary
One of the drawbacks of the new design is that although there is an increase in the amount of data being filtered out (5 fields), it
relies on the user already knowing what data they will be filtering through. It would be beneficial if there was a pull down feature as
well to show what available options there are. For example, with the way it currently works, if a user were to input a data filled out as
1/01/2010, it would return nothing even though there seven 1/1/2010 dates available. This would remove any confusion based off of 
incorrect spellings as well. Another recommendation for further development would be to incorporate further data to connect the current
identified UFO sightings to any relevant articles or video clips to allow visitors to continue their research onto UFO's.
